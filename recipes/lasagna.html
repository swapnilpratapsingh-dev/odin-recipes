        <li>Spread 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spread
            1/2 of the ricotta mixture over noodles; top with another layer of noodles.
            Pour 1 1/2 cups of sauce over noodles and spread the remaining ricotta over the sauce.</li>
